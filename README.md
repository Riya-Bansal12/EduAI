## 1. Problem Statement Name

AI-Powered EdTech Platform with 3D AI Professor

---

## 2. Problem Statement Description

Current online learning platforms are static and lack personalization. Students watch pre-recorded videos and take generic quizzes, which makes them passive learners and leaves many skill gaps unaddressed. Our solution is an interactive EdTech platform powered by an AI-driven 3D Professor that teaches, answers doubts, and creates personalized learning paths.

---

## 3. Project Overview

We are building an AI-powered EdTech platform designed to close the skill gap in education. The 3D AI Professor delivers immersive, interactive lessons, provides real-time doubt solving, and tailors learning paths to each student based on their strengths and weaknesses. The system continuously evaluates performance through quizzes and projects, identifies gaps, and fills them with personalized content. With features like AI-generated courses, adaptive assessments, analytics dashboards, and project-based practice, this platform ensures engaging, job-ready learning experiences.
